# The Project

Make sure you follow the steps in [README.md](README.md) first!

This project is designed to give you and understanding of a couple of things:

1. Get familiar with writing HTML.
2. Get familiar with writing CSS, focusing on flexbox and some modern styling techniques.
3. Get familiar with writing JavaScript, using jQuery, and making simple API calls.

We're going to do this iteratively, starting with writing HTML and CSS, then moving into the JavaScript part. 

## What We're Building

We're going to build a simple weather app. It will display:

1. The current temperature.
2. Whether its sunny, rainy, or cloudy.
3. The current date.
4. The current location.
5. The forecast for the week.
6. The current Humidity level, Wind level, and Rainfall.

[I have put together a design for you](https://www.figma.com/file/EwKTxUtqWVVUuyyuAHpUbH/Pathfinder-Weather?node-id=0%3A1). All of the pictures and assets you'll need are in the `images/` folder. 

## Phase One: HTML and CSS

An `index.html` file has been set up for you, as well as a `styles.css` file. These should be about all you need at this point. It's unlikely this project will have more than one html file, but if you were to ever add more, you'd likely want to make a new directory and place them in there. 

See [Dealing With Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files) for more recommendations. 

The first part of this project is pretty standard. Go ahead and implement the design for the Sunny screen, using only HTML and CSS. Here are some resources on the key technologies you'll need to make this happen:

#### **CSS**
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) (You should try to use flexbox as much as possible for making this layout.)

- [Background Blur](https://blog.prototypr.io/how-to-make-a-background-blur-in-css-with-one-line-of-code-e446c7236e60)

- [Basic CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps)

#### **HTML**
